## Demo

This demo shows how to compose directives using the new `hostDirectives` feature in Angular standalone components. The `FancyButtonComponent` uses both a tooltip and a highlight directive, forwarding their inputs.

Try hovering over the button to see both the tooltip and highlight effects in action.
