  <h2>Example 1 - Basic Defer on Idle</h2>
  <p>This example demonstrates a defer block that loads content when the browser becomes idle.</p>
  
  <div class="demo-section">
    <h3>Immediately Loaded Content</h3>
    <mat-card>
      <mat-card-content>
        This content loads immediately when the component is rendered.
      </mat-card-content>
    </mat-card>
    
    <h3>Deferred Content (loads on idle)</h3>
    @defer (on idle) {
      <mat-card>
        <mat-card-content>
          <h4>üéâ This content was loaded when the browser became idle!</h4>
          <p>This demonstrates the basic defer block functionality. The content inside this card was not loaded initially but only when the browser had idle time.</p>
          <p>Defer blocks help improve initial page load performance by postponing non-critical content.</p>
        </mat-card-content>
      </mat-card>
    } @placeholder {
      <mat-card>

        </mat-card-content>
      </mat-card>
