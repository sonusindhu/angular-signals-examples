| # | Example | Key Concepts | Description | Live Demo |
|---|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Signal-based HTTP Resource** | Signals, resource(), HTTP, error handling | Modern HTTP data fetching with signals | [ðŸ”— Demo](https://angular-signal-examples.netlify.app/advanced/advanced-example-1) |
| 2 | **HTTP Caching with shareReplay** | RxJS shareReplay, HTTP caching, signals, refresh | Efficient HTTP caching using RxJS shareReplay and signals | [ðŸ”— Demo](https://angular-signal-examples.netlify.app/advanced/advanced-example-2) |
| 3 | **ng-template: Real-World Use Cases** | ng-template, context, outlets, custom directives, dynamic content | Comprehensive demo of advanced ng-template patterns | [ðŸ”— Demo](https://angular-signal-examples.netlify.app/advanced/advanced-example3) |
| 4 | **Signal-based Disable Reactive Form** | Signals, reactive forms, custom directive | Control the disabled state of a reactive form using a signal and directive | [ðŸ”— Demo](https://angular-signal-examples.netlify.app/advanced/example4) |
| 5 | **Auto-Save Form Directive** | Signals, reactive forms, throttle, LocalStorage, API, error handling | Reusable directive for auto-saving form data with status and retries | [ðŸ”— Demo](https://angular-signal-examples.netlify.app/advanced/example5) |

| 7 | **Track Angular Performance** | Learn how to track and visualize Angularâ€™s change detection cycles in zoneless mode. This example shows how to override ApplicationRef.tick to log every global change detection run, explains why async operations like setInterval do not trigger ticks, and demonstrates how to manually trigger change detection for performance analysis. | [ðŸ”— Demo](https://angular-signal-examples.netlify.app/advanced/example7) |
